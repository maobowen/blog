Welcome to 101对双生儿's blog! This blog will be the place to host my technical articles, class notes and personal posts. Thanks [MOxFIVE](http://moxfive.xyz) for providing such an amazing [theme](https://github.com/MOxFIVE/hexo-theme-yelee) on [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a fast, simple and powerful blog framework based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). The site is still under construction, so more contents will be added later.

Born and raised in Shanghai, I am now a computer science graduating senior, pursuing dual bachelor's degrees from [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu) and [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). I am interested in software engineering, computer systems and artificial intelligence. You can find my résumé from the link on the left side, and my current projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maobowen). Feel free to talk to me!

The blog will be displayed in English; however, many posts will be available in either English, or Chinese, or both. Should you need any translation please let me know.

See you soon!
